# TODO
- [Enable https](https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-use-ssltls-with-node-js/)
# To consider
- code a function in the models to automatically generate an id.
## Code
- figure a way to set `process.env` to configure devmode, production, etc
- Add automatic validations by, for example, setting `Model.attributes.column.validate` objects in object definitions.
  - [Sequelize validation](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/validations-and-constraints.html)
## Interesting plugins
- [Multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer): Middleware for uploading files
- [Sequelize CLI](https://github.com/sequelize/cli)
